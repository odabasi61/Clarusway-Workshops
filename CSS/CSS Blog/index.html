        <h1>What is halftone?</h1>
        <p>
          Halftone is defined as a reproduction of an image in which dark and
          light variations in tone are produced by variously sized dots. It was
          originally invented as a technique for printing images in journals and
          other publications at a time when other printing processes were
          prohibitively expensive. You might have come across the style in older
          comic books, where colour reproduction was limited.
