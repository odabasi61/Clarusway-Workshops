- Because the height of the inputs is too high, there is a bug when clicking the Movie Type checkboxes and Gender Types, it needs to be fixed.

- In Gender Types and Movie Types, it should be done as Label-Input so that the user can also select text by clicking on it. Like I do in Comedy.

- The black border that occurs when all inputs are focused should be removed.

- The sign in the lower right that adjusts the size of the textarea should be removed.
